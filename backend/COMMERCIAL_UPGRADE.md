# Commercial Features Implementation Plan

## Current Status

We've prepared the commercial upgrade for the application with the following components:

1. **Organization Module** (Temporary Implementation)

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Schema Migration**
   ```bash

   cp src/prisma/schema-update.prisma src/prisma/schema.prisma
   
   # Generate the migration
   npx prisma migrate dev --name commercial_upgrade
   ```

2. **Update Services**
